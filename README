#####################Quick steps to syncing and build Evervolv#########################

Getting Started


####Install the Android SDK. #####

####Install the Build Packages####

Install using the package manager of your choice:

	For 32-bit & 64-bit systems:

		git-core gnupg flex bison gperf libsdl1.2-dev libesd0-dev libwxgtk2.6-dev squashfs-tools build-essential zip curl libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev sun-java6-jdk pngcrush

	For 64-bit only systems:

		g++-multilib lib32z1-dev lib32ncurses5-dev lib32readline5-dev gcc-4.3-multilib g++-4.3-multilib

Note: On Ubuntu 10.10, and variants, you need to enable the parter repository to install sun-java6-jdk:

	add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ lucid partner"



Create the Directories

	You will need to set up some directories in your build environment.

		To create them:

			mkdir -p ~/bin 

			mkdir -p ~/android/system



Install Repo

	Enter the following to download make executable the "repo" binary:

		curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo

		chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

		Add 'export PATH=~/bin:$PATH' to your .bashrc

	You may need to reboot for these changes to take effect.



Now enter the following to initialize the repository:

	cd ~/android/system/ 

	repo init -u git://github.com/Evervolv/android.git -b jellybean

Then to start the Sync. (This is gonna take awhile)

	repo sync



All proprietary files are kept in the repo, no need to pull them from your device (unless adding devices).



Configure Build 

	Now, your environment must be configured to build specifically for your device. To set up your build environment:

		. build/envsetup.sh

		lunch

	Now choose the correct device, supersonic for the Evo 4g, inc for the Droid Incredible.



Next, we will build the actual ROM. You have a few build choices, described below. 

	First option will do a straight build

		make 

	Second option will specify the amount of jobs you want to run (replace # with number of cpu cores, or be adventurous and max it out!)

		make -j#

	Third option will create an OTA zip file that can be flashed through recovery This can be used with '-j#'.

		make otapackage

Completed! Your compiled Evervolv rom will be located in ~/android/system/out/target/product/INSERTPRODUCTHERE/ (the entire build is in /system if you did not use otapackage).
